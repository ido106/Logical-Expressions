# Logical Expressions

OOP course assignment in java

implementation of a system that can represent nested logical expressions that include variables, evaluate their values for specific variable assignments, convert them, and simplify the results.

In doing so we will work in a recursive framework, see some more examples of polymorphism, and practice the use of inheritance and class hierarchies for sharing common code.

Our goal is to represent logical expressions such as:
~((T & (x | y))^x)
Where T is a value of "True", the ~,|,&,^, symbols denotes the "not","or","and" and "xor" operators respectively, and x and y are variables.
